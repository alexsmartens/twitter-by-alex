## Ruby on Rails Tutorial sample application
This is a simple application that I developed to introduce myself to Ruby on Rails with [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/) by Michael Hartl. Check out Twitter by Alex [here](https://twitter-by-alex.herokuapp.com). At the moment, the app is hosted on Heroku however it is possible that the link does not work anymore when you try to see the app because Heroku is planning to shut off its free Postgres plan ðŸ¥²
