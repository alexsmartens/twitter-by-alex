<%# 'remote: true' attribute - tells rails to make an Ajax call, which allows
    pages to send requests asynchronously to the server without leaving the
    page (in other words, without a need to go to the controller and get a
    redirect back)
%>
<%# Ajax stands for "asynchronous JavaScript and XML"
