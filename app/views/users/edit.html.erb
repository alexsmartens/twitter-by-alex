      <%# 1. target="_blank" - opens the link in a new window %>
      <%# 2. There’s a minor security issue associated with using target="_blank"
              to open URLs—namely, the target site gains control of the
              “window object” associated with the HTML document. As a result,
              the target site could potentially introduce malicious content,
              such as a phishing page. This risk can be eliminated entirely
              by setting the rel attribute (“relationship”) to "noopener"
              in the origin link %>
